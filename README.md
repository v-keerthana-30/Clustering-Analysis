# Clustering
This project focuses on unsupervised learning to identify patterns and groupings within a dataset. 

The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing & EDA: Handle missing values, remove outliers, scale features if necessary, and explore data distributions with visualizations to identify potential clusters.

Clustering Implementation: Apply K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN algorithms using Python (scikit-learn) or MATLAB. Experiment with parameters like K-values (Elbow method), linkage criteria, epsilon, and minPts to optimize clustering results.

Cluster Analysis & Interpretation: Analyze and interpret the characteristics of clusters, providing insights about the grouped data.

Visualization: Visualize clusters using scatter plots or other suitable plots with different colors to show separation of data points.

Evaluation: Assess clustering quality using metrics like silhouette score to compare the performance of different algorithms.
